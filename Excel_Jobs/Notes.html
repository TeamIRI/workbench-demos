  <h1>Jobs to demonstrate direct Excel (.xlsx and .xls) file support with sortcl</h1>
  <p>This project includes three different example folders that demonstrate various functionalities of SortCL in use with .xlsx or .xls sources or outputs.
  <p>The <strong>Data Class Library Masking</strong> folder displays using a data class library created by IRI Workbench to classify and mask sensitive data in Excel files.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Data Migration</strong> folder demonstrates aggregating and performing calculations on an input .xls file, and outputting to multiple targets.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Test Data</strong> folder demonstrates generating realistic test data into a .xlsx file.</p>
  <p>To run each job, open the respective sub-folder, right-click on the .scl, .rcl, or .fcl file, select Run As.. from the dropdown menu, and run as an IRI job.</p>
<h2>Data Class Library Masking</h2>
<p>The data class library masking demo involves creating a data class library first. To do this, click on the dropdown menu from the microscope icon. Select the directory
data class search option. On the first page, select the include graphical report option to produce an HTML visualization. On the second page, select the <strong>Input</strong> directory. In the data class matchers, select the <strong>Sensitive</strong> data class group to match on.</p>
<h2>Test Data</h2>
<p>Select New Test Data Job from the RowGen menu, to the left of the FieldShield menu identified by the golden shield icon.
Select the Field Layout option, add a field and apply test data generation rules to each field. 
A record filter can be applied; in this demo the record filter is limiting a numeric field to be within a certain range. When a record filter is applied on input with /PROCESS=RANDOM, records will be generated until the number specified by /INCOLLECT is met.
Keep this in mind when applying conditions with a very small chance of being met, as this will increase the run time of the job.
In the action section, I have chosen to sort by one of the generated fields. Output is to a .xlsx spreadsheet file with a specified sheet name and header row.
</p>
<h2>Data Migration</h2>
<p> Select New Sort Job from the CoSort menu. Add a new file data source. Select XLS as the file format.
 Browse to select the .xls file from the Inputs folder. Specify the header option. Use the discover metadata wizard to get metadata (field layout) from the XLS file. 
 For the action section, sort with a key of the Date field. Add outputs for a flat tab-delimited report file and an XML file into the Outputs folder. A headrec, or header record, may be added to the tab-delimited stockreport file from the edit target options menu. An include statement may be added from the record filter menu. All
 of these options may be accessed later by right clicking on the script, going to the IRI context menu, and selecting the edit targets option.</p>
