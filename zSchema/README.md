## Database Schemas for Demo Projects
The files *SCOTT-DDL.sql*  and *TEST-DDL.ddl* contain the SQL necessary to create all 
of the tables used in the demo projects. There are usually SQL files in each project, 
this is just a convenient way to create the tables at one time. It is useful when 
setting up a demo environment for the first time.

If you have no existing tables, then do not execute the relevant DROP statements at the 
top of the file.
