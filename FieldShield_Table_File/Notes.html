  <h1>Encrypting and Masking PII in a Database</h1>

  <p>This project demonstrates most of the FieldShield (and
  CoSort/SortCL) capabilities for securing data in a database table
  and sending the protected results to a table and file. It also
  allows you to reverse the process and restore the original table.
  This demo is a single-source example that highlights IRI's
  data-centric protection ability in general. The separate,
  multi-table project applies protection rules across multiple
  tables to make job design more convenient and to preserve
  referential integrity.</p>

  <p>This demo requires and uses the following resources:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The DTP connection profile Oracle</li>

    <li>The ODBC DSN Oracle</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Before running this demo, 
  expand the setup folder and 
  right-click <em>reset_demo.bat</em>. Select 
  <strong>Run As &gt; Batch Program</strong>.</p>

  <p>Remember that this is a convenient method for populating small
  tables. In this example. SortCL inserts via ODBC. Using the DB load 
  utility on large tables is generally a much faster load method.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>patient_enc.scl</em> creates two
  targets; one is the PATIENT_RECORD_ENCRYPTED table, and the other
  is a flat file called "stdout" which displays in the Workbench
  console. The targets differ in the number of protections
  assigned. The table target is constrained to its format, but is
  only encrypted so that the <em>patient_dec.scl</em> job can
  decrypt it. The /OUTFILE=stdout /FIELD layouts contain more
  field-level, including irreversible protection functions.</p>

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Run the encryption job and
    examine the results by expanding the scripts folder.
    Right click <em>patient_enc.scl</em> and select 
    <strong>Run as &gt; IRI Job</strong>.

	<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    In the Data Source Explorer, right click on the
    PATIENT_RECORD_ENCRYPTED table and click
    <strong>Data &gt; Sample Contents</strong> to see how the rows
    were sorted (since CoSort/SortCL was the licensed executable in
    this case), and see how the credit card and driving license
    columns were protected with format preserving encryption. In
    the Console, see how the same sorted data were also protected
    with the other scripted functions.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Though these job scripts were pre-written, they could have been
    created through the New Masking Job wizard from the
    FieldShield toolbar menu. The wizard steps users through the
    identification and layouts of their sources, and the rules to
    apply protection in the target field layout editor which also
    allows re-mapping and formatting. This dialog can also be
    reached from the syntax-aware job script editor: right click
    anywhere in the script and select <strong>IRI &gt;
    Edit Targets</strong>.</li>

    <li>Note additional value adds<br>
      <br>

      <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Functional choice:<br>
        Certain FieldShield protections are reversible (i.e.
        encryption &gt; decryption, encode &gt; decode, de-ID &gt;
        re-ID, pseudonyms using source data files), while others
        are not (pseudonyms from foreign sets, masking, hashing,
        string manipulation, and randomization).
        Another design consideration is appearance:
        format-preserving encryption and pseudonymization are
        suitable for test data applications and to preserve
        referential integrity when applied in the same way to
        linked columns across multiple tables.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Encryption key
        management:<br>
        FieldShield encryption keys can be literal strings in the
        script, a referenced (and secured) file containing the
        passphrase, or an environment variable that a system
        administrator or third-party key management application can
        populate. HSM and other tokenizing appliances preferred by
        end-users may interface in this way or through field-level
        functions for which IRI provides an API call.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Granularity and
        singularity:<br>
        Field-level protections target only the data that needs
        protecting, and is thus the most efficient way to secure
        large amounts of data. A single job script can also produce
        one or more target tables or files at the same time,
        avoiding data synchronization problems when multiple
        recipients and authorizations are in play.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Task and application
        integration:<br>
        FieldShield functions can run in the same job script and
        I/O pass with data transformation, conversion, and
        reporting in the SortCL program if CoSort is licensed.
        FieldShield jobs can be called into database and other
        applications. In-situ protections for SQL procedures can be
        customized by IRI for particular databases.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Teamwork and audits:<br>
        FieldShield and all other job scripts in the IRI Workbench
        can be shared and, via version control, compared using
        <a href=
        "http://www.iri.com/blog/iri/iri-workbench/introduction-metadata-management-hub/">
        Git</a>, SVN, CVS or another source code control system in
        Eclipse. FieldShield (and other IRI) jobs can also
        optionally create runtime performance and application-level
        statistical logs. They can also create XML log files with
        each execution that allow auditors and compliance teams to
        review the runtime context and scripted protections
        applied. This <code>/AUDIT</code> log feature is designed
        to verify the specific protections applied (or removed) to
        each data source and column, when, and by whom.</li>
