  <h1>Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Demo</h1>

  <p>A dimension is a structure that categorizes facts and measures
  similar to a categorical variable in statistics. However,
  dimensional data can change slowly over time, rather than on a
  regular schedule.</p>

  <p>There are five types represented in the SCD Wizard:</p>

  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Type 1</strong> &ndash;
    This model involves overwriting the historical value with the
    current value. No history is maintained.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Type 2</strong> &ndash;
    The current and the historical records are kept in the same
    file maintained in one table.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Type 3</strong> &ndash;
    The current data and historical data are kept in the same
    record. The user decides how much history is kept in the
    record.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Type 4</strong> &ndash;
    In this model, the current data is maintained in two different
    tables; one for the current data and one that contains all the
    historical data.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Type 6</strong> &ndash;
    This model is a hybrid of Type 1, Type 2, and Type3.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Follow the instructions on each page to fill out the page.
  There is a ".dat" file for each of the needed inputs for the
  five types. All input files end with a number designating which
  type they go with except for "update" which is the same file for
  all types. This is true of the metadata files too. The wizard
  default is to overwrite the existing input files. Choose a new
  file to write your output to so that the original input files are
  preserved for the next user.</p>

  <p>In the examples in this project, the following were used in
  the trigger fields:</p>

  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Flag = CURRENT</li>

    <li>Flag Positive = Y</li>

    <li>Flag Negative = N</li>

    <li>Start = START_DATE</li>

    <li>End = END_DATE</li>

    <li>End Value = 99991231</li>

    <li>Historical Sets:</li>

    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group1 = COST1,
    START_DATE1, END_DATE1</li>

    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group2 = COST2,
    START_DATE2, END_DATE2</li>

    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group3 = COST3,
    START_DATE3, END_DATE3</li>

    <li>Current = COST</li>

    <li>Historical = HISTORICAL_COST</li>
  </ul>

  <p>On the mapping page, all fields in the update file were mapped
  to fields in the output file.</p>

  <p><strong>Notes</strong>:
  <li>At least one mapping must be entered on the mapping page. Any
  field in the update file should be mapped to a field in the
  master file.<br>
  <li>All of the combo and text boxed are optional. For example, a user
  may not use an end field. However, if these boxes are not filled
  out, output may not be as expected.<br>
  <li>Current field means the field that includes the value being
  updated in each execution (i.e. Cost).<br>
  <li>Historical means the previous value of the current field.<br>
  <li>Type 3 keeps a certain amount of previous values. If the user is
  keeping historical data, then the current and historical set
  section must be filled out for each set (including the
  current).</p>

  <p>The script should be reviewed after it is produced and
  customized as needed. This wizard may not cover the exact
  scenario of your SCD process.</p>
