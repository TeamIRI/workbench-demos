# Workbench Demos
Various projects that demonstrate the features and capabilities of [IRI Workbench](http://www.iri.com/products/workbench).

If you don't have IRI Workbench, [download](https://www.iri.com/download/cfb3932705f536b635948696688c1d994d6e95f8) the 64-bit Windows build from the IRI website. Other builds are available on request. IRI Workbench requires JRE 1.8, which is now bundled into the download.

Check out some, or all, of these projects into your workspace in IRI Workbench. Each project has a notes.html file with instructions.
