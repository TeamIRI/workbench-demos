  <h1>Generating Referentially Correct Test Data</h1>

  <p>For most DBA and DW ETL architects, the purpose of RowGen is
  to create compliant, useful test data with the same formats and
  relationships as production data, according to the structure and
  relationships of target databases. RowGen can combine both
  artificially generated data values with randomly selected real
  data to enhance security and realism.</p>

  <p>In the IRI Workbench, RowGen leverages both:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>The Data Tools Platform (DTP)</strong></dt>

    <dd>for database viewing and work. The DTP front-end in Eclipse
    is the Data Source Explorer panel, where you connect to your
    online database tables through JDBC and use the DDL information
    available about the tables you select for test data creation to
    automatically build the RowGen data generation scripts.</dd><br>

    <dt><strong>The CoSort Sort Control Language
    (SortCL)</strong></dt>

    <dd>data definition and manipulation/formatting program. RowGen
    uses its familiar syntax and engine parts to pre-sort the test
    data for faster bulk loads into target tables. The 4GL also
    supports deep test data customization, transformation and
    layout options in case you need to generate test data in file
    and detail/summary report formats. RowGen metadata is also
    ready for use in SortCL when testing shifts to production.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The New Database Test Data Job wizard, which combines the two
  technologies, is used to create and load multiple tables in a
  database with structurally and referentially correct test
  data.</p>

  <p>Recommended steps to perform this demo in IRI Workbench:</p>

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Users of the RowGen Test DB job wizard are assumed to have an
    identical SQL file that defines their production
    database table names, layouts and relationships. You will build
    the same, but empty, table structure and this job will 
    populate it with test
    data. 
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    In this example, we are providing DDL information for a
    database subset, which you can see illustrated in the metadata
    folder by double-clicking on the
    <em>ERD &gt; DM.sqlschema</em> file. If you do not
    have these tables, you can build them for RowGen to read from
    and populate with test data: open
    <em>reset.sql</em> in the setup folder and right-click and
    select <strong>Execute All</strong>. View these empty "DM_"
    table names in your Oracle schema connected in the Data Source
    Explorer view.<br>
    If the tables exist,
    execute <em>six-table-truncate.sql</em>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Select the New Database Test Data Job wizard in the 
    RowGen menu toolbar. Note that you can 
    also highlight the project folder, select the relevant tables 
    in the Data Source Explorer and right-click 
    <strong>IRI &gt; New Database Test Data Job</strong>
    to pre-select the tables.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Specify the project location
    (RowGen_Test_DB_Data) and the name (new_batch). Click
    <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Select <strong>Oracle</strong> and the six DM_* tables. 
    The metadata descriptions will be extracted and parsed by
    RowGen in order to create the test data generation scripts for
    those tables. You can also do this with the filter .*DM_.* If
    you selected the tables before starting the wizard, you will
    see that the six tables are pre-selected on this page.
    Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    On this page, you specify the parameters by setting global or 
    table-level options. In the
    <strong>Default rows to generate</strong> field, assign and use
    the default (/INCOLLECT value) of 100, or enter a different
    number.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    From the <strong>Loader</strong> drop down menu, select the
    loader to create the loader control files (for Oracle in this
    case) so that the final batch job file will be able to populate
    the tables automatically with pre-sorted direct path
    loads. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">On the Field Modification
    Rules page, specify rules for the test data.<br>

      <ol type="a">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Enter a name for the
        matcher; for this demo, enter <em>Companies</em>. 
        Next to the <strong>Rule
        name</strong> field, click <strong>Create</strong> to make
        a new rule.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Select <strong>Set File
        Selection</strong>. In the <strong>Rule name</strong>
        field, enter <em>CoName</em>. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Next to the <strong>Set
        file</strong> field, click <strong>Browse</strong> to
        locate the set file. Navigate to <strong>C:\IRI\CoSort(or
        RowGen)\sets</strong>. Select
        <strong>american_companies.set</strong>. Accept
        the default for the other fields. A description of the
        available options is available on the help page. This will
        have the effect of displaying randomly selected real
        company names from that set file in any column in all the
        target tables that has COMPANY_NAME as a column name. Click
        <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Back on the Rule
        Matcher page, click <strong>Add</strong> to add the details of
        the matcher. On the Rule Matcher Details page, leave
        the default as Pattern. In the <strong>Details</strong>
        field, enter <em>.*COMPANY_NAME</em>, and click
        <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Click <strong>OK</strong>. 
        On the Field Modification Rules page, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ol start="8">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The Summary page shows the
    batch file and scripts that will be generated based on the
    information you have provided. Click
    <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Examine the metadata.<br>
    When you have finished the wizard, inspect the files it created
    in the newBatch sub-folder in your project. The RowGen
    Control Language (.rcl) job scripts
    can be modified here to change data values generated.
    Referential integrity is preserved by the data generation (and
    table loading) order since table dependencies were
    established to respect primary-foreign key relationships. See the
    <a href="#ri">notes</a> below for more information on
    Referential Integrity.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Run the data generation and
    loading job.<br>
    In the newBatch sub-folder in your project, right-click on
    <em>newBatch.bat</em> and select <strong>Run As &gt;
    Batch Program</strong>. Note all the tables were bulk loaded 
    with 100 rows (unless
    duplicates or row-specific changes were seen). Additional
    selection (.sel) and seed (.sed) files are added to the
    subfolder.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Examine the new test tables in
    the Data Source Explorer.<br>
    Click on <strong>Oracle &gt; XE &gt; Schema &gt; Tables</strong>,
    and right-click on DM_COMPANIES. Select
    <strong>Data &gt; Sample Contents</strong>,
    and note the company name from the <em>companynames.set</em>
    file. Open the other tables in the same way and note that
    COMPANY_ID order is maintained since it is a primary key.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Clean-up (to re-run).<br>
    To re-run the demo, remove the newBatch folder
    and, in the setup folder, open
    <em>six-table-truncate.sql</em> and right-click to select
    <strong>Execute All</strong> to truncate the target
    tables for future population.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Create set files</h3>

  <p>Create your own sets of new, intelligent test data by
  automatically building custom set files you can assign to one or
  more (pattern-name-matching) columns in your tables. RowGen has
  these other mini-wizards for populating set file values for test
  columns needing:</p>

  <ul>
    <li type="disc"><strong>Compound Data Values</strong> -
    combining generated components and literal values, like part
    numbers or identification numbers</li>

    <li type="disc"><strong>Range or Literal Values</strong> -
    based on literal values or values selected from a range.</li>

    <li type="disc"><strong>Set from Column</strong> - extracting
    values from a database table.</li>

    <li type="disc"><strong>Pseudo Set from Column</strong> -
    extracting values from database tables.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You will need to click inside the Set
  File Wizard dialogs in order to activate the help content for
  each screen.<br>
  Regardless of the contents of the set files you choose to use or
  create, RowGen will randomly select from their values when
  displaying the test data in each column, so as to protect
  identities and frequency realism. However, RowGen also gives
  users the choice of the random selection method: ANY, ALL, ONCE,
  PERMUTE, SUFFIX, and ROW. See the on-line documentation for a
  description of these options. The Row option is a facilitator for
  creating safe test DB subsets and test data containing valid
  pairs.</p>

  <h3><a name="ri" id="ri">Notes regarding referential integrity
  (RI)</a></h3>

  <p>Primary Keys are detected and placed in the action section of
  the script to be sorted. An output section is created for each
  key also. The output will create a <em>.set</em> set file and
  will contain one field. These set files are then used in the
  referencing RowGen job scripts.</p>

  <p>Each table is checked for references and dependencies. These
  are listed in the comments at the top of each RowGen job. This
  also determines the order of execution of the RowGen jobs in the
  <em>.bat</em> file.</p>

  <p>Special Set files with the <em>.sed</em> extension are
  also needed to preserve RI. This seed set file is created for
  columns with a Unique constraint. The seed set files are created
  before the RowGen jobs are executed. This assures that the field
  corresponding to that column is unique. Self referencing foreign
  keys also need to use a seed set file since at run time the set
  does not yet exist.</p>
