  <h1>Simultaneous Data Transformation and Reporting in the File
  System</h1>

  <p>This project demonstrates several of CoSort's data
  transformation and reporting capabilities in a single SortCL job
  script, <em>stockjoin.scl</em>. A second job called
  <em>mortgage.scl</em> shows two more reporting features -
  derived field and math logic.</p>

  <p>Note that both of these jobs were created prior to the IRI
  Workbench, and may not be the type of SortCL job the GUI user
  would enjoy creating. Nonetheless, the IRI Workbench accepts
  pre-existing, complex SortCL job scripts and allows you to modify
  and run them with section (e.g. /OUTFILE) and attribute (e.g.
  /FIELD-specific) GUI dialog editors.</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Master Data Management (MDM) and
  Customer Data Integration (CDI) reporting applications are also
  possible in SortCL, though purpose-driven wizards are not yet
  built into the GUI. End-users and consultants appreciate the
  flexibility that SortCL scripts provide for job design,
  maintenance, and external execution.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>To use <em>stockjoin.scl</em>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Open both data sources from
    the project's <em>InputFiles</em> folder 
    (nyse-a.txt, buys.csv) to see the
    formats and the field they share: the three-letter stock ticker
    symbol.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Open the
    <em>stockjoin.scl</em> script, located in the 
	<em>scripts</em>
    folder. It performs a sort and join on both input files in the
    action section and generates multiple output reports. These
    reports contain target-specific transforms, such as selection
    and aggregation. More than two data sources
    are possible, including relational tables connected via ODBC.
    Field-level protections could also be applied.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Open the Targets/TradingA
    output file contents and layouts. They include the results of
    the full outer join, cross-calcs and the final aggregate.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The requirement to have 2-3 different (summary and detail)
  formats in targets like TradingA and the html version are common
  in custom SortCL BI reports; however, they are not intuitive for
  GUI users to write. 
  
  <!--
  Note that BIRT is a free eclipse plug-in that
  provides for more graphical reporting capabilities and that IRI
  Workbench users can now use a direct integration between SortCL's
  data preparation (franchising) job scripts and BIRT
  visualizations. See the CoSort_BIRT_Report demo in the project
  folder.

  <p>To use <em>mortgage.scl</em>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Open the following files:<br>
    <em>InputFiles/mortgage.dat</em><br>
    <em>scripts/mortgage.scl</em></li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Right click the script and select
    <strong>Run As &gt IRI Job</strong>
    to see the output header format and detail (payment)
    values.</li>
  </ol>
