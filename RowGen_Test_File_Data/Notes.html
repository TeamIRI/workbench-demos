  <h1>Generating Realistic Test Data in Custom File Formats
  Reports</h1>

  <p>In addition to structurally and referentially correct test
  data for databases, RowGen can create compliant, valuable test
  data with the same format and characteristics as data in
  production files and two-dimensional (2D) reports.</p>

  <p>In the IRI Workbench, RowGen leverages
  both:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>The CoSort Sort Control Language
    (SortCL)</strong></dt>

    <dd>data definition and manipulation/formatting program. RowGen
    uses the simple syntax and engine to filter, transform and map
    test data into one or more custom file and structured report
    formats at generation time. Targets can be files, pipes, ODBC
    or procedures. RowGen metadata is also ready for use in SortCL
    when testing shifts to production<br>
    <br></dd>

    <dt><strong>Workbench Facilities</strong></dt>

    <dd>for project and metadata management, an IRI new job
    wizard, job outline, and dialog editors for test data creation
    and target file/report formatting in one or more RowGen (or
    SortCL) job scripts.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The two technologies combine into a purpose-built wizard for
  writing one or more test file targets in flat-file and/or
  structured report formats.</p>

  <p>This project contains set file generation scripts and a report
  generation script. Set files are typically used in RowGen scripts
  as randomly-selected sources of real data. They populate columns
  in test files, or tables, ad hoc, or on a rule-specified basis.
  The sample .rcl files show that RowGen field data is generated or
  selected at random.</p>

  <p>To create your own test files from scratch:</p>

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Think about the file layout
    you are looking for and locate existing metadata (.ddf), if
    any. Otherwise, plan to build the new layouts one field at a
    time.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Run the New Test Data
    Job wizard in the RowGen menu to create a new set file,
    flat file, or custom report. Follow the instructions and
    consult the in-context help. Or, use (and modify) an existing
    .rcl script example.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Study and run your .rcl
    scripts (like examples already built in the script folder) and
    see the output and set files they produce. Each time you re-run
    these jobs different output values will be produced due to
    random generation (or selection).</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Edit the scripts in the
    editing windows or via Outline view by right-clicking on a
    source (generation) or target field and clicking
    <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">You can re-use the
    set files you built in previous scripts inside new scripts.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To experiment further:</p>Use the New Set File wizard to
  create real data lists for random selection and population of
  field values in RowGen scripts. Wizards
  support:

  <ul>
    <li type="disc">data falling within numeric ranges or specified
    directly as Literal Values</li>

    <li type="disc">real data in one or more columns in a database
    table (Set from Column)</li>

    <li type="disc">real-looking data formats you construct on the
    fly as a Compound Data Value (e.g., add a parens, 3 whole numbers,
    parens, 3 whole numbers, dash, 4 whole numbers for US tel. area codes)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can choose the random selection
  method: ANY, ALL, ONCE, PERMUTE, SUFFIX, and ROW for sets. See
  the on-line documentation for descriptions of these options.</p>
