  <h1>Data-based Change Data Capture (Delta Reporting)</h1>

  <p>This project demonstrates many of CoSort's data transformation
  and reporting capabilities in a single SortCL job script,
  <em>CDC.scl</em>. See below for more information:</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Master Data Management (MDM) and
  Customer Data Integration (CDI) reporting applications are also
  possible in SortCL, without purpose-built job wizards in the IRI
  Workbench. The ability to help customers build these kinds of
  reports manually for SortCL is therefore a services revenue
  opportunity for you, and a combined product offering that buyers
  of separate ETL and BI tools can appreciate for the savings in
  time, training, and money that SortCL represents. End-users and
  consultants appreciate SortCL scripting for its simple job
  design, modification, deployment and sharing.</p>

  <p>To use <em>CDC.scl</em>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Open both input files (<em>current.txt</em> and <em>previous.txt</em>) 
    in the sources folder to see the formats. Note the common
    fields between them.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Examine the job script -
    <em>CDC.scl</em>:<br>

      <ul>
        <li type="disc">input layouts</li>

        <li type="disc">/JOIN statement</li>

        <li type="disc">fields</li>

        <li type="disc">condition logic -- this is used to display
        and select the various types of changes on the basis of the
        checksum field value</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Run the job by 
    right-clicking on <em>CDC.scl</em>
    and selecting <strong>Run As &gt; IRI Job</strong>, or click the
    green play button in the top menu.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Open the targets folder and double click on
    <em>TestDeltas.out</em> to see how all forms
    of the changes are displayed in that file. It is also possible
    to output only the individual changes and format them similarly
    (as you can see in the other .out files), or in a custom way
    with other layouts and calculations that produce business
    intelligence from the comparisons.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Clean up by
    deleting the 5 output files in the target folder.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>As an advanced exercise, make additional output targets and/or
  new scripts to produce additional, customized reports.</p>

  <p>IRI Workbench now includes a purpose-built wizard, in the
  Voracity menu, to create change data capture jobs. For an
  overview on using this wizard, see <a href=
