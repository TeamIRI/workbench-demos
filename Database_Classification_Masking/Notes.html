  <h1>Database Classification and Masking</h1>

  <p>This demonstrates the use of data classes and masking on a schema in a database.</p>

  <p>This demo requires and uses the following resources:</p>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The DTP connection profile Oracle</li>

    <li>The ODBC DSN Oracle</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Setup:</h2>
  
  <p>In order to use data classes in the wizards, they must be configured first
  in preferences. This allows them to be globally available
  because they can represent business rules which wouldn't change depending on
  the project. Rules are also needed so that a consistent result is produced
  across all tables involved. Rules are added to a library per project.

  <ol>
  
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  	Navigate to <strong>Preferences &gt; IRI &gt; Data Classes and Groups</strong>.
  	Depending on the operating system, Preferences can be under Window or 
  	IRI Workbench on the Mac.
  
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    On the preference page, confirm that these exist:<br><br>

  	<ul type="disc">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Class <em>CREDIT_CARD</em> that uses
        <em>\b((4\d{12}(\d{3})?))|(?:5[1-5][0-9]{2}|222[1-9]|22[3-9][0-9]|2[3-6][0-9]{2}|27[01][0-9]|2720)[0-9]{12}|(3[47]\d{13})|(3(0[0-5]|[68]\d)\d{11})|(6(011|5\d{2})\d{12})|((2131|1800|35\d{3})\d{11})|(8\d{15})\b</em>
		as a matcher.

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
		Class <em>EMAIL</em> that uses
		<em>\b[\w._%+-]+@[\w.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}\b</em>
		
        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Class <em>LAST_NAME</em> that uses
        <em>"C:/git/workbench-demos/Database_Classification_Masking/sets/lnames.set"</em>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Class <em>PHONE_US</em> that uses        
        <em>^(\+?(1)([ .-]?)?)?(\(?([2-9]\d{2})\)?([ .-]?)?)([2-9]\d{2})([ .-]?)(\d{4})([ #eExXtT]*)(\d{2,6})?&</em>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Class <em>PIN_US</em> that uses
        <em>\b([0-9]{3}[-]?[0-9]{2}[-]?[0-9]{4})\b</em>
      </ul>
      
      <br>If they do not, click <strong>Restore Defaults</strong>.
      
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
    At the top of the preference page, is an entry <em>Matching
    Threshold</em>. This option is to allow you to determine the 
    level of matching required before assigning a data class. The schema
    scan will scan 4K blocks of data until it reaches this threshold. 
    If it never reaches this threshold, then no data class is assigned.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
    Because there are columns that contain last names but may not be 
    named "LAST_NAME" and may not have data contained in the set file,  
    a regular expression can be used to match on the name. For instance, 
    there may be a column named LNAME or LASTNAME. So, the LAST_NAME 
    data class needs to be edited. Click the row of LAST_NAME and click 
    <b>Edit</b>. Change the name to <em>L(AST)?[_-]?NAME</em> 
    (that is an underscore and dash in the brackets). Click <b>OK</b>.
    Click <strong>Apply and Close</strong>.

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    You need to determine what the output format will be so that you can add rules.
    In this example, a partial redaction, a format-preserving encryption, and
    a pseudonymize rule.
    
    <p><strong>Rule 1</strong></p>

	  <ol>
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	    Select your project in the Project Explorer.
	    Add rules by selecting <strong>IRI menu &gt; New Rule</strong>.
	    
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	    Select <strong>Field Rules</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.
	
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	    Select <strong>Pseudonym Replacement</strong>
	    and click <strong>Next</strong>. 
	    
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
		Select <b>Use your own pseudonym list</b> and click
		<b>Browse</b>. Select 
		<em>C:/git/workbench-demos/Database_Classification_Masking/sets/lnames.set</em> .
		Select <b>Use random draw</b>.
		Click <strong>Finish</strong>.
	  </ol>

  	<p><strong>Rule 2</strong></p>

	  <ol>
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	    Select <strong>IRI menu &gt; New Rule</strong>.
	    
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	    Select <strong>Field Rules</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.
	
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	    Select <strong>Redaction Function</strong>, 
	    add <em>SSN</em> to the end of the rule name
	    and click <strong>Next</strong>. 
	    
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	    Select the
	    <strong>Define Mask</strong> radio button. Type
	    <em>1</em> in <strong>Start position</strong> and
	    <em>5</em> in <strong>Length</strong>. Click
	    <strong>Add to Table</strong> and <strong>Finish</strong>.
	  </ol>
    
  	<p><strong>Rule 3</strong></p>

	  <ol>

	    Enter <em>secret</em> in <strong>Passphrase</strong>.
	    Click <strong>Finish</strong>.
	  </ol>
    
  </ol>

  <h2>Schema Data Class Search Wizard:</h2>
  
  <p>The schema data class search performs the classification using 
  the data classes set up in the previous exercise. You can 
  select as many schemas as needed within one database. But note that
  if the schemas are large, the wizard will take a while to run.  

  <ol>
  
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Right-click on the SCOTT schema 
    in the Data Source Explorer(DSE) and select
    <strong>IRI &gt; Schema Data Class Search</strong>.

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    On the setup page, enter the
    location to save the dataclass file. There can only be one of
    this file type in each project, hence the read-only status of
    the name field. Leave the defaults as is. Click
    <strong>Next</strong>.

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    The input page shows that one schema is selected. Click
    <strong>Next</strong>. 
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    The next page allows you to limit the columns searched by data types.
    Include <em>NUMERIC</em>. Click <strong>Next</strong>.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    The Exclude Items page allows you to exclude tables or columns
    during the scan. Click <strong>Next</strong>.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    This page allows you to filter the data classes that will be used
    during the scan. Select only
    <em>CREDIT_CARD</em>, <em>EMAIL</em>,
    <em>L(AST)?[_-]?NAME</em>,
    <em>PHONE_US</em>, and <em>PIN_US</em>.
    Click <strong>Finish</strong>. Along with reports, 
    this will create (or append) a data class library
    with the mappings between source columns
    and data classes. The form editor opens.
  </ol>

  <h2>Data Class Library Form Editor:</h2>
  
  <p>The library stores the mappings between sources,
  data classes and rules. The form editor is where rules
  are assigned. This is also where changes can be made 
  to assign or add different data classes to sources on a per
  source basis.

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Click on the data source to display details about that
    source. If a match to a data class was made, that column
    shows that data class and how it was matched.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Edits to the data class mappings can be made here by either
    changing the data class via drop down or unselecting the
    column to remove the mapping completely. <br><br>
    
  	<ol>
    	<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    	If a table is empty, it may not assign all the mappings
    	desired. There are three ways to handle this.

		<ul type="disc">
		
			<li>
			You can add the tables to the exclude page in the 
			classification wizard above so that it is not
			added to the data class library
			
			<li>
			If the table may have data in the future, assign the
			data classes manually here. Then either
			
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>Uncheck them in the masking wizard
				
				<li>Leave them and the masking wizard will
				create job scripts that will run but do no masking
    	 	</ul>
    	 	<li>or, remove the data source from the data class library
    	</ul> <br>
    	
		In this example, click each of the following data sources and click
		<strong>Remove</strong> since they are empty or 
		don't need to be masked:<br>
		<em>SCOTT.DEMO_ROWGEN</em><br>
    	<em>SCOTT.DM_EMPLOYEES</em><br>
    	<em>SCOTT.PATIENT_RECORD_ENCRYPTED</em>
		
	    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
		Sometimes matches are missed because the data is not valid 
		or the data class matcher needs to be modified. Care needs to
		taken to verify the results in the data class library before masking.
		
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>
			In this example, a data class
			needs to be manually assigned because there are invalid 
			US phone numbers but we want to mask the column anyway:		
	    	<em>SCOTT.EMPLOYEES.PHONE_NUMBER &gt; PHONE_US</em>
    	</ul>
    </ol>
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Once the results are reviewed and modified if necessary,
    click on the data classes in the library to assign default
    rules. This will allow you to assign the rules to all the sources
    by just assigning a default rule to a class.
    
    In this example, assign the following:<br>
    <em>CREDIT_CARD &gt; FieldRedactionRule</em><br>
    <em>EMAIL &gt; FieldEncryptionRule</em><br>
    <em>L(AST)?[_-]?NAME &gt; FieldPseudonymRule</em><br>
    <em>PHONE_US &gt; FieldEncryptionRule</em><br>
    <em>PIN_US &gt; FieldRedactionRule</em><br>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
	You can see the rule assignments by clicking on a data source.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">    
    If a column in a particular table needs a different rule, 
    those can be assigned after the default rules by
    changing them in the data source.
  </ol>

  <h2>Data Class Database Masking Wizard:</h2>
  
  <p>The masking wizard uses the data class library
  to assign rules to the columns with data class
  matches. Each table with a field to be masked
  will have a job script created. All of those job scripts
  can be executed with the batch or shell script that is
  also created by the wizard.

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    Right click the <em>iriLibrary.dataclass</em> in the 
    Project Explorer. Select <strong>IRI &gt; New
    Data Class Database Masking Job</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    On the setup page, change the <strong>Output</strong>
    to <em>Flat files</em> so that a flat file
    is produced and the results are easily seen. 
    Click <strong>Next</strong>.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    On the Data Class page, leave all data classes selected.
    Click <strong>Next</strong>.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    On the Data Sources page, leave all items selected.
    If there were tables that you did not want to run the job
    on, you would unselect them here. 
    Click <strong>Finish</strong>.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    The job scripts are created and a flow diagram is opened
    that represents the entire job serialized as a batch file.
    Each table that will have a column masked is represented
    by a brown transform mapping block serialized as a 
    script.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    The transformations are seen by double-clicking a transform
    mapping block and noting the orange lines to the output.
    This shows that the column is being changed from input.
    Clicking in the field to the right of the orange line and viewing 
    properties view at the bottom of the screen, 
    the field math statement shows the transformation
    type.
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    In the <em>new_classProtection</em> folder, right-click the
    <em>new_classProtection.bat</em> file and select
    <strong>Run As &gt; Batch Program</strong>. 
    
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    The job will be executed and the outputs can be viewed in
    the job folder.
  </ol>
