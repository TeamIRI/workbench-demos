  <h1>Create an ETL Flow from Scratch Demo</h1>

  <p>This demonstrates how to create a flow diagram in the IRI
  Workbench from scratch for an ETL job performing a join. It also
  shows you how to customize specific transforms in the flow. The
  sources for this demo are tables from an Oracle database.</p>

  <p>The goal in this demo is to acquire information for a report
  that shows the freight amount being charged to customers in
  different states.</p>

  <p>Recommended steps to perform the demo:</p>

  <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Create the blank flow</em>

      <ol>
        <li>In the Project Explorer, expand the
        FromScratch folder.</li>

        <li>From the <strong>File</strong> menu in the top
        navigation bar, select
        <strong>New &gt; Flow</strong> to open the
        Flow screen and create a new flow file.</li>

        <li>In the first field, you will see Flow/FromScratch, if
        you pre-selected the project. If not, enter it now. Name
        the flow in the File name field, for example,
        <em>name.flow</em>. Click
        <strong>Finish</strong>. The new diagram is preloaded with
        a Flowlet and a Start block.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Open the flow diagram</em>

      <ol>
        <li>In the Project Explorer, double click the
        <em>name.flow</em> file.</li>

        <li>Select <strong>Transform Mapping Block</strong> from
        the palette and drop it into the Flowlet. Double-click it
        to open the mapping diagram.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Specify the input tables</em>

      <ol>
        <li>Select <strong>ODBC</strong> from the Input section of
        the palette and drop it into the Input Data block. The
        Table Selection dialog opens. Select the Oracle profile,
        and then select the CUSTOMERS_FLOW and ORDERS_FLOW tables.
        Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>

        <li>Select the Input Data block and click <strong>Arrange
        Selection</strong> from the diagram menu on the top
        navigation bar.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Set up the Join action</em>

      <ol>
        <li>Move the Action block to the right side of the Input.
        Drop <strong>Join</strong> from the palette into the Action
        block. A join dialog opens and allows you to select the
        fields on which you want to join.</li>

        <li>Select ID in Data source 1 and CUSTOMER_ID in Data
        source 2. Click the <strong>Create Condition</strong>
        button, and then <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>

        <li>Move the grey box so that you can see the fields. The
        default is that all input fields are added and connections
        are made. However, there are a lot of unneeded fields for
        this report. Select those fields: ID, NAME, PHONE,
        ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, and hit the delete key on your
        keyboard. Notice that not only are the fields deleted, but
        so are the mappings.</li>

        <li>Select the Join block and click <strong>Arrange
        Selection</strong> from the diagram menu.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Define the target(s)</em>

      <ol>
        <li>Move the Output Data block to the right side of the
        Action block. Note that you will need metadata
        <strong>(ddf)</strong> files of any file or stdout output
        before you move on to the next step.</li>

        <li>To verify the information before the output file is
        written, drop a <strong>stdout</strong> from Output in the
        palette. A dialog displays allowing you to select the
        format of the output (using a ddf).</li>

        <li>Select both CUSTOMERS_FLOW.ddf and ORDER_FLOW.ddf,
        Click <strong>OK</strong>. Delete unneeded fields: ID,
        NAME, PHONE, ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID.</li>

        <li>Select the Output Data block and click <strong>Arrange
        Selection</strong>. Click <strong>Save</strong> in the File
        menu.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Create the execution (job) script</em>

      <ol>
        <li>Click in the white space of the background of the flow
        to view the properties for the Transform Mapping Block.
        Note in the Properties that the IRI Job is the name of the
        file that the script version of this diagram will be saved
        as in the current directory.</li>

        <li>Right-click in the white background and select
        <strong>IRI Diagram Actions &gt; Export
        Flow Component</strong>. This action creates the script
        version of this transform mapping block.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Make changes to the flow</em>

      <ol>
        <li>After reviewing the script, we now realize we
        don&rsquo;t want our colleagues to see the
        ORDERS_FLOW.TOTAL amount. Go back to the Transform Mapping
        Block diagram and right-click
        <strong>ORDERS_FLOW.TOTAL</strong> in the output.</li>

        <li>From the IRI Diagram Actions menu item, select
        <strong>Apply Rule</strong>. A dialog opens to allow you to
        browse for an existing rule or to create a new one.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Apply a rule</em>

      <ol>
        <li>Select <strong>Create</strong>. A new screen opens with
        different types of rules that can be applied. Select
        <strong>Masking Functions</strong>, and click
        <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

        <li>Select the library location to save the rule and name
        the rule. Click <strong>Next</strong> and the options
        display for that rule type.</li>

        <li>We will use the default for this demo, so click
        <strong>Finish</strong>. The details of the rule to be
        applied are shown in the Apply Field Rule dialog. Click
        <strong>OK</strong> and the new rule is applied to the
        field as indicated by the different field icon and orange
        connector. The orange connector indicates that the target
        field is a derived field.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Add an include filter</em>

      <ol>
        <li>We are also only interested in higher freight sales.
        Click <strong>Filter Include</strong> from the palette and
        drop it in the Section Options of the output.</li>

        <li>When the dialog opens, click the expression builder
        button in the <strong>New Condition</strong> field, and
        select <strong>Field
        Names &gt; ORDERS_FLOW.FREIGHT</strong>.</li>

        <li>Finish the expression by entering
        <em>&gt;10</em> at the end.
        Click <strong>Finish</strong>, and then
        <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <em>Save and rename the job</em>

      <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. Click in the white
        background, and in the Properties, change the IRI Job to
        <em>iriJob2.scl</wme>.</li>

        <li>Create a new script, as shown in step 6. Notice in the
        script that the expression to mask the field is now shown
        in the output, as is the include statement.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>To add more task
    blocks...</em> Click on the Flow diagram and any additional
    needed blocks can be entered. For example, drop a
    <strong>Change Directory</strong> block between Start and the
    transform mapping block. Enter the directory path:
    <code>C:\git\workbench-demos\Flow\FromScratch</code>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>Use existing scripts in
    the flow...</em> Existing IRI job (CoSort SortCL, FieldShield,
    and NextForm) scripts, as well as FACT Configuration files can
    be dropped into the Flow diagram. The blocks can be connected
    using the Connection from the palette. To start, click on
    <strong>Connection</strong>, then click on the source and then
    the target. The icon will change to show where in the blocks to
    add the connector. Click on the Flowlet and click
    <strong>Arrange Selection</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>To save and run jobs in
    batch...</em> Click on the white background to show the
    properties of the batch job. The Name is what any batch files
    created will be named in the current directory. Click
    <strong>Save</strong>. Right click in the white background and
    select <strong>Flow Actions</strong>&rarr;<strong>Write to
    Batch File</strong>.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>If you change anything,
    re-serialize...</em> Items can be added, deleted, or changed at
    any time. The scripts or batch files would then need to be
    recreated.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>You can preview the
    results first...</em> Specify stdout as the target file name to
    see results on the screen (console view). After you run your
    script and see that the data is to your liking, you can go back
    to the Transform Mapping Block and change the File Data Info
    from stdout to <strong>output.txt</strong> so that a file is
    created at the end of the execution of the batch file. You can
    then share the report with colleagues.</li>
