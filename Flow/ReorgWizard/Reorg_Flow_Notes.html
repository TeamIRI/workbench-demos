  <h1>Create a Reorg Flow from a Wizard Demo</h1>

  <p>This demonstrates how to create a reorg flow diagram in the IRI
  Workbench using the New FACT Offline Reorg Job wizard. It also shows
  you how to customize specific task blocks in the flow. The
  sources for this demo are tables from an Oracle database.</p>

  <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Before running this demo, 
  expand the setup folder and 
  right-click <em>reset_demo.bat</em>. Select 
  <strong>Run As &gt; Batch Program</strong>.</p>

  <p>Recommended steps to perform the demo:</p>

  <h2>Create the job script using the wizard</h2>
  
  <ol>
        <li>In the Data Source Explorer, select
        <strong>Oracle &gt; XE &gt; Schemas &gt; SCOTT &gt;Tables</strong>,
        and select the two tables called
        CUSTOMERS_FLOW and ORDERS_FLOW. Right click and select
	    <strong>IRI &gt; New FACT Multi Table Reorg</strong>, or you
        can select the New FACT Multi Table Reorg Job wizard
        from the FACT menu in the top navigation bar.</li>

        <li>On the setup page, select the Oracle loader. Go to the
        next page.</li>

        <li>On the Data Extraction Stage page, see that the tables
        are already selected, so go to the next page.</li>

        <li>On the Field Modification Rules page, because we want
        to mask the TOTAL, enter
        <em>TOTAL</em> in the pattern field
        and click <strong>Test for matches</strong> to confirm that
        the column is found. Click <strong>Create</strong> in the
        rule name and details line to create a new rule. If you
        have an existing rule, you would click
        <strong>Browse</strong> to locate and select the rule.</li>

        <li>Select <strong>Masking Functions</strong> and click
        <strong>Next</strong>. Enter a rule name and click
        <strong>Next</strong>. &nbsp;The default mask is acceptable
        for this demo, so click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>

        <li>Back on the Field Modification Rules page, be sure to
        click <strong>Add to table</strong> so the rule is applied.
        Now click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>

        <li>On the Data Loading Stage page, select the profile for
        the load phase, which is Oracle for this demo. Because we
        have only one schema, it is picked automatically.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to display the Summary
        page, or click <strong>Finish</strong> if you do not need
        to see the summary.</li>
      </ol>

	<h2>Create the flow diagram</h2>
	
      <ol>
        <li>In the Flow/ETL project in the Project Explorer, the
        new_batch folder contains all the scripts needed to execute
        this job. To see the visual representation of the job,
        double-click the <em>new_batch.flow</em></li>

        <li>Double-click on the Transform_SCOTT.ORDERS_FLOW block
        to open the Mapping Diagram. You can see any
        transformations that are being done and to which fields.
        Note the orange arrow next to the TOTAL field indicating a
        derived field. The TOTAL field in the output is now called
        MASK_TOTAL. Double-click that field to display the Target
        Field editor where you can see the changes to the field in
        detail.</li>

        <li>The palette allows you to add additional items if
        needed. In this demo, we are only interested in higher
        freight sales. Click <strong>Filter Include</strong> from
        the palette and drop it in the Section Options block of the
        ORDERS_FLOW output. When the Record Filtering dialog opens,
        click the expression builder button (in the New Condition
        field) and select <strong>Field Names &gt; FREIGHT</strong>.
        Finish the expression by entering
        <em>&gt;10</em> at the end.</li>

        <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The include filter is added
        to the Section Options in the diagram.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Using the wizard to create the
    basic framework for the reorg job speeds up the process if you
    are using the visual workflow to create your project. Any
    needed customizations can then be made to the specific blocks
    in the flow diagram or the mapping diagram.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Note that if changes are made
    to any blocks, the batch file needs to be recreated. To do
    this:

      <ul>
        <li>right-click in the background of the flow diagram, then
        from the Flow Actions menu, select <strong>Write Batch
        File</strong>, or</li>

        <li>select <strong>Export Flow Component</strong> from the
        Flow menu in the top navigation bar, or</li>

        <li>recreate the scripts individually by clicking on the
        background of the specific Mapping Block in the flow
        diagram, and then selecting Write to Script from the Flow
        Actions menu. You can also do this in the mapping diagram
        by right-clicking and selecting Write Mapping to Script
        from the Mapping Actions menu.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In addition to building the
    flow diagram from scratch using the palette, you can also drop
    existing IRI scripts or FACT Configuration Files into the flow
    diagram and then connect items as needed. Go back to the flow
    diagram and drop <strong>iriJob.scl</strong> from the Reorg
    folder into the gray flowlet block.</li>
  </ul>
